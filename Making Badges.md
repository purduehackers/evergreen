# 1. Brainstorm an idea
Steps 1 and 2 are interchangeable as it can be easier to come up with a theme / badge idea after looking at the acrylic. 
Past themes we have done include references to pop culture and media, relevant things happening in the world or on campus (ex. 4.6, 3.11), or something new on its own like 3.2, 3.16, 4.7.
Typically a standalone theme works best on average, but some reference badges have been very strong as well (ex. 4.3, barbenheimer).
Also consider basing the badge off of an idea rather than a specific thing like 4.2. 

# 2. Buy acrylic
We get a lot of our acrylic from [Canal Plastics Center](https://www.canalplastic.com/products/0b008-rt-radiant-iridescent-acrylic-sheet) but Amazon and others are fine too. 
One 12x18 sheet with 1/8" thickness have produced 35-50 badges. Consider the theme to find a fitting acrylic or find something cool and inspiring!

# 3. Design the badge
Starting with a drawing can help. Then import the drawing into a vector graphics software of your choice. Figma, Illustrator, or Vectr are probably your best bet.
