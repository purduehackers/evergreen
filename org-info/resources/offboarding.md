# Off-boarding

When someone decides to step down from organizer-ship we follow Matthew's philiosophy in not fully removing their access
to the club's resources. This is because we believe that the knowledge and experience that they have gained while being
an organizer is valuable to the club and we want to make sure that they can still contribute to the club should they
choose to do so.

## Steps to Off-board

1. Ensure all current projects and tasks have been handed off to other officers or division leads.
2. Remove `@Organizer` role and give the `@Past Organizer` role in Discord.
3. Remove any division roles that they may have.
4. Update [CODEOWNERS](../../.github/CODEOWNERS) in the [purduehackers/evergreen](https://github.com/purduehackers/evergreen)
   repository to avoid tagging them in future PRs.
5. Replace `admin` access to any repositories that they may have with `write` access.
6. Remove them from the Google Drive and any other shared resources.
7. Ask [@infinidoge](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/infinidoge.md) to remove them
   from the access list for the [Lawson Office](../locations/lawson-office.md).
8. Update the [Roles](../structure/roles.md) document to reflect the change.
9. Give them a shoutout in the [#core](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/890595036855685181) channel in
   Discord :)

## Special Cases

### Presidents and Treasurers

If the President or Treasurer steps down, the club will need to be re-registered with the university. This process
should be facilitated in advance by the outgoing President. Reference [Registration](./registration.md)
for more information.
