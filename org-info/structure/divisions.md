# Divisions

To best explain divisions, I'll quote Matthew:

>  Divisions are an implementation detail & necessary evil, not the first thing people should hear about.\

Divisions are a way to think about grouping projects such that management load on the president is reduced. Each
division handles a specific aspect of the club's operations. Each division also has a lead who is responsible for
overseeing the division's activities and ensuring that they align with the club's goals.

This is not, however, a hard and fast rule. In fact, most organizers are involved in projects in multiple divisions,
and that's okay! The division structure is meant to help organize the club's activities, not to restrict them.

There are currently 5 divisions in Purdue Hackers:

1. [Communications](../../comms/README.md)
2. [Design](../../design/README.md),
3. [Engineering](../../engineering/README.md)
4. [Events](../../events/README.md)
5. [Finances](../../finances/README.md)

## Division Meetings

Each division also has its own meetings. These may be 1:1 meetings with your division lead or group meetings with other
members of your division. These meetings are a great way to stay up-to-date with your division's activities and to get
help with any projects you're working on.
