# Visual Identity Refresh 2025 Doc

- **DRIs**: @[firefoxofficial], @[okaibee], @[natlam2028]

## Objective

Visual identity refresh for Purdue Hackers that more accurately reflects our brand. 

## Background

### Problem
1. Our style, which is somewhat along the lines of neobrutalism, is a bit too common nowadays and does not fully reflect the identity that Purdue Hackers has; that is to say creative, innovative, fun and technical. Purdue Hackers members can be described as both makers and disruptors.
2. There is not a cohesive understanding as to how to design something for Purdue Hackers, particularly 2d assets. If we are to reflect our brand more accurately, it is helpful to have a knowledge base and guide to jump off of while designing. The website does not have this problem, but a quick look at the Instagram reflects a wide variety of styles. Although not necessarily a bad thing, it is not the direction Purdue Hackers is moving in. 

### Stakeholders
Purdue Hackers

### Existing Solutions
Continue with current visual identity we have on our website and Instagram


## Requirements
Figma, Adobe Illustrator*

### Goals
1. Make a crazy cool website.
2. Make enough 2d assets that can be interchangably used for flyers, brochures, and other promotional materials.
3. Have easily accessible branding guide other designers can refer to
4. Create a clear, cohesive, and beautiful visual branding to define Purdue Hackers by.

### Non-Goals
Brainwash the masses with how awesome our style is.
Be on the Times Square billboard.

## Milestones
font needs to be finished
brand identity guide under [@okaibee] completed
cohesive understanding of assets needed to be made
cohesive understanding of what the website will look like
??? need to ask and think

## Additional Considerations
Designers afterwards should be able to use the branding guide to create new assets as they wish. 
Assets designed should go through a couple rounds of review by other designers before being used on social media.
