# Materials

We get a lot of our [acrylic from Canal Plastics Center][canal-plastics-acrylic],
but Amazon and others are fine too. One 12x18 sheet with 1/8" thickness has
produced 35-50 badges. Consider the theme to find a fitting acrylic or find
something cool and inspiring! 

The vast majority of our badges are made with acrylic purchased from
[Canal Plastics][canal-plastics] in New York. We have also
made badges out of plywood from [Menards][menards-plywood] in the past, and
there are many opportunities for badge materials that remain unexplored, such as
various metals and other random things that are safe to laser cut.

We like acrylic because there are many different colors, variations, and effects
available that can be used to make badges look unique. We also like that it is
easy to work with and relatively inexpensive.

For simplicity, this guide will assume you are ordering acrylic from Canal
Plastics. But don‚Äôt take this as a rule.


## Acrylic

Order from [Canal Plastics][canal-plastics][^1]. They have a wide variety of
colors and finishes available.

- If you happen to take a trip to New York, stop by their physical store on Canal
  St. and buy as many as you can fit in your suitcase. That way you don‚Äôt have to
  pay for shipping, plus they offer student discounts if you buy in person, so
  all in all it‚Äôs a lot cheaper.
  - Purchase 2 12x18 sheets or 1 12x18 and 1 12x12.
  - We‚Äôve found 2 12x18 is enough material to make badges for 90-110 people, and
    1 12x18 + 1 12x12 is enough to make 60-90 badges. Of course it depends on
    your design, size of the badge, and how effectively you align the badges on\
    the day of manufacturing.
- As of Fall 2024, laser cutting happens on Wednesday, so material must arrive by
  Tuesday at the latest. For Canal Plastics, this means
  **material must be ordered by the previous Thursday** (one week and one day
  before its intended Hack Night)
- Use your own card and put the receipt in the `#receipts` channel. If you can't
  front the money, DM me to use my virtual card.
- Keep total costs below $40. Ideal is $30-35.
- If you‚Äôre ordering a typical opaque or transparent acrylic (e.g. blue
  transparent, not the special stuff like pearl/mirror/etc), also check Amazon
  for the same material. It's usually cheaper on amazon, and ships faster. The
  catch is that they don‚Äôt have as much stuff as the üêês at Canal Plastics.

We typically use 1/8" thick acrylic for our badges. For badge cutting you
should purchase either:

- 2x 12" x 18" sheets (perfect for 90-110 badges)
- 1x 12" x 18" sheet and 1x 12" x 12" sheet (perfect for 60-90 badges)

We typically have a stockpile of acrylic in the office, so check if we can
exhaust that before ordering more. If we do need to order more, we typically
order eight days in advance to ensure that we have enough time to receive the
acrylic before we need it.

[^1]: While typically order from Canal Plastics, if it's an opaque or transparent
      colors, try checking Amazon as it may have cheaper and faster options. They
      often don't have the same variety of colors, but they're good for last
      minute orders.
