# Materials

The vast majority of our badges are made with acrylic purchased from
[Canal Plastics](https://www.canalplastic.com/) in New York. We have also
made badges out of plywood from [Menards](https://www.menards.com/store-details/store.html?store=3511)
in the past, and there are many opportunities for badge materials that remain
unexplored, such as various metals and other random things that are safe to
laser cut.

We like acrylic because there are many different colors, variations, and
effects available that can be used to make badges look unique. We also like
that it is easy to work with and relatively inexpensive.

## Acrylic

Order from [Canal Plastics](https://www.canalplastic.com/)[^1]. They have a
wide variety of colors and finishes available.

> If you happen to take a trip to New York, stop by their physical store on
> Canal St. and buy as many as you can fit in your suitcase. That way you
> don’t have to pay for shipping, plus they offer student discounts if you
> buy in person, so all in all it’s a lot cheaper.

We typically use 1/16" thick acrylic for our badges. For badge cutting you
should purchase either:

- 2x 12" x 18" sheets (perfect for 90-110 badges)
- 1x 12" x 18" sheet and 1x 12" x 12" sheet (perfect for 60-90 badges)

We typically have a stockpile of acrylic in the office, so check if we can
exhaust that before ordering more. If we do need to order more, we typically
order eight days in advance to ensure that we have enough time to receive the
acrylic before we need it.

[^1]: While typically order from Canal Plastics, if it's an opaque or
      transparent colors, try checking Amazon as it may have cheaper and
      faster options. They often don't have the same variety of colors, but
      they're good for last minute orders.
