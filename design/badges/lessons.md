# Lessons we’ve learned from previous badges

## Positive

* **Hack Night 2.4 (Spy):** Until this point, badges were engrave-heavy designs on a simple cut line, but this badge taught us that the opposite—simple engraving but driven by a creative cut line—can make for even better badges.
* **Hack Night 2.7 (Moon):** A really good design paired with a really good material can make the best badge we’ve ever made.
* **Hack Night 3.2 (Puzzle):** A badge can be the spark for a super memorable communal activity; in this case, putting a puzzle together & everyone takes a piece of the puzzle home.
* **Hack Night 3.0 beta, 3.6, 3.7 (Barbie, Ghost, Spider):** Grayscale, when used tastefully and in moderation, like only on one part with super high contrast, can look very good.
* **Hack Night 4.2 (Frutiger Aero):** The best badge we’ve ever made. Up until this point we had used grayscale very sparingly because we were afraid to repeat the scuba badge. 4.2 was like the scuba badge but it was executed so well that it’s the best badge we’ve ever made. We learned that you can have lots of grayscale with a high fidelity image—you don’t have to use grayscale sparingly—as long as you keep the contrast high enough and use it very intentionally.
* **Hack Night 5.1 (Desert):** You can make pearlescent material work if it’s dark and you decrease the speed and up the power on the laser cutter.
* **Hack Night 5.3 (Vine Puzzle):** You can turn a badge into an ARG and make the best badge we’ve ever made.
* **Hack Night 5.8 (Ghost Tiling):** Get your smart friends to programmatically generate a badge and you’ll end up with the best badge we’ve ever made.

## Negative

* **Hack Night 1.5 (Wanted):** This was a great badge, but it was made out of wood which is SO annoying to clean. It took me like 3 hours to clean and even after that some of them still had some soot if you ran your fingers over them. After that I vowed never to use wood for a badge again because the cleaning process is probably not worth it.
* **Hack Night 2.0 (Golden Ticket):** Brightly-colored _and_ opaque materials (in this case, yellow) do not engrave well. For opaque materials, use dark colors. If you want a brighter color, use a transparent or fluorescent material.
* **Hack Night 2.3 (Scuba):** If you use grayscale for engraving, make sure the colors are high-contrast, otherwise it will come out super muddy. The engraving won’t necessarily match what it looks like on Figma.
* **Hack Night 3.3 (Lightning Time):** Don’t make a badge too small (under 2.0 inches).
* **Hack Night 3.7 (Spider):** Don’t make a part of a badge too thin or it will be structurally weak. (This was still a really good badge though)
* **Hack Night 4.1 (1984/all-seeing eye):** This was a “negative” badge where everything was engraved except for the design. The laser cutter is pretty high fidelity but not enough to make that look good unless your design is very minimal and thick. It also makes it super annoying to clean. This was a good badge though.
* **Hack Night 4.4, 4.5, 5.7 (Prisms, Flowers, Pet Rock, Smiski Hippers):** Don’t have more than one version of the badge, and _certainly_ not more than 2, because then you’ll run out of badges because badge collectors will try to collect them all. It’s a cool idea but just don’t do it unless you really have to. We did a lot Spring ’24 because the 4.3 Prism badge was so good and we got high off of the idea of multiple badges but don’t do it just don’t do it!!!!! Unless you do something else like prism that is very intentional about it and only has 2 versions! And even then, think twice and thrice about it!!!!!
* **Hack Night 4.7, 5.7, 5.16 (Mars, Smiski Hippers, Monster Energy)**: If you use the default engrave and cut settings for pearlescent acrylic from Canal Plastics, the engraving will show up very faintly. Even if you increase the power to 100% it will still be too faint. Avoid this pearlescent acrylic. If you must use it, use a darker color like violet.
* **Hack Night 5.0 (BRAT):** This was a great badge but it’s the only one that doesn’t have the date on it and I think we should have worked the date in.
* **Hack Night 5.4 (Flat Earth/UN):** Make your engrave lines thicker than 1px, ideally 3% of the entire design, otherwise they won’t show up very well.

## Neutral/Both

* **Hack Night 5.9 (Metal/Laser/CAD):** Metal badges are expensive and annoying. We only did this one because we were sponsored, and we did it right before the metal laser cutter died and it took like 3 hours. I probably wouldn’t do it again, but I’m really glad we did it that one time.
