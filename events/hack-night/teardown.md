# Teardown

Hack Night technically ends when there are two people left. A Hack Night can be considered running when there are at
least three people still present. Two of those people must be awake, the other can be asleep.

When the last two people are ready to leave, they must ensure that the space is clean and that all equipment is put
away. The following checklist will help with Hack Night teardown:

- [ ] Throw away all pizza boxes into recycling bins.
  - It may help to break down the boxes first so you can maximize the space in the recycling bins.
- [ ] Put any tables and chairs back where they originally came from.
- [ ] Clean up any food, wrappers, plates, or napkins that may have been left behind.
- [ ] Check for any badges people may have left behind. If you find any, put them back in the badge bag.
- [ ] Put badges back on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Put away any Passport-making materials on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Put door opener away onto the Hack Cart and retrieve the QR code sign.
- [ ] Unplug the dashboard from the projector and put it on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Unplug the Sign from the wall and put it on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Take Hack Cart back to the Purdue Hackers office in Lawson B128.
