# Countdown

The Countdown occurs at approximately 11:59 PM and is a time for members to gather around the front of the room and count
down to midnight in [Lightning Time](/engineering/lightning-time/README.md). It starts at `f~f~f|0` and ends at `f~f~f|f`
(see the Lightning Time docs to understand how counting works).

To initiate the Countdown, gather organizers and members around the front of the room. At `f~f~f|0`, start counting until
`f~f~f|f`. Once the Countdown ends, announce that [Checkpoints](/events/hack-night/checkpoints.md) will begin immediately after.

**It is very important that the Countdown happens every canonical Hack Night, as it is an integral part of the event.**
