# Attendance

Tracking attendance is an important part of Hack Night. It helps us keep track of how many members are attending each
week, a crucial metric in understanding the health of the event, advertising to sponsors, and more.

## How to Track Attendance

Create an attendance thread using [Attendance Bot](../../engineering/attendance-bot/README.md) or a forum post in
[#hack-night-attendance](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/1287861645628149760) on Discord. Organizers
should take attendance every hour starting at 8:00 PM and noting when Hack Night ends when the last person leaves.

If attendance is missed at any point, it is important to take it as soon as possible. This ensures that we have somewhat
accurate attendance numbers for the night.

See [Attendance Bot](../../engineering/attendance-bot/README.md) for more information on how to use the bot to track
attendance and generate reports.
