# Reading Circles

Reading Circles (colloquially Circles) are typically run from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM to 11:59 PM during
Hack Night. They are similar in form to [Sessions](/events/hack-night/sessions/README.md) but are recurring, generally spanning the
entire semester.

Circles are often led by community members and gather near the circle couches. A facilitator is responsible for
leading the Circle, preparing content for the session, and ensuring that the session runs smoothly. Past examples
of Circles include the Data Analytics Circle and the Spoken Language Project.
