# Spoken Language Circle

The Spoken Language Circle was started Spring 2024 by [@stopwatchtt](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/stopwatchtt.md)
and covered lingustic concepts with the ultimate goal of creating a conlang for Purdue Hackers. The Circle was active for the
Spring 2024 and Fall 2024 semester.

[TODO(@TheBlueTopHat): describe more history of this Circle]

For the [Fall 2024 show](/events/archive/burst-f24/README.md) the Spoken Language circle created Vine Script, a script that
was a main feature of the show.
