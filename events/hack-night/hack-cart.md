# Hack Cart

The Hack Cart is located in the Lawson Office (B128). It contains supplies and projects that are setup before Hack Night
begins. An organizer should get the Hack Cart from the Lawson Office and bring it to the Hack Night location before
8:00 PM and place it in the kitchen area.

The Hack Cart should be cleaned up and returned to the Lawson Office after Hack Night ends.
