# Hack Cart

The Hack Cart is located in the Lawson Office (B128). It contains supplies and projects that are setup before Hack Night
begins. An organizer should get the Hack Cart from the Lawson Office and bring it to the Hack Night location before
8:00 PM and place it in the kitchen area.

The Hack Cart should be cleaned up and returned to the Lawson Office after Hack Night ends.

## Hack Cart Return Procedure

Since the hack cart contains most if not all of our standard Hack Night equipment and due to the nature of how late hack night ends, the following generalizable procedure has been made for returning the hack cart. 

1. The easiest procedure: the last organizer brings the hack cart back the the Purdue Hackers office whenever they are leaving.
2. Lack of Use: If there has been no use/need of the hack cart and its requisite materials for multiple hours, the hack cart should be returned.
3. Critical mass falls below a general threshold, tentatively below 10-15 people, believe it or not, return the hack cart.
4. Hack Cart Curfew: To prevent the case in which all remaining parties are too tired to remember teardown, bring the hack cart back at tentatively 4 am.

These are not definitive rules, simply guidelines to ensure tear down is performed in a reliable way while ensuring efficiency and accountability.
