# Sessions

Sessions are typically run from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, where a Hack Night member will present a topic or lead a discussion
on a topic. Sessions are more spontaneous than [Reading Circles](/events/hack-night/circles/README.md) and can be on any topic, often
a concept related to computer science or technology.

Sessions are also a great way to incorporate any sponsors or guest speakers, as they can present on a topic of their
choice.

## How to Organize a Session

To organize a session, follow these steps:

### Find a Presenter

Find a member who is willing to present a topic or lead a discussion. This can be yourself or another member. This
should ideally be done a week in advance to give members time to prepare. If not, find someone who is willing to
spontaneously present a topic.

If the presenter is not a frequent or well-known member, prior to offering a session, have a conversation with them
to judge on the following:

- [ ] the appropriateness of the topic
- [ ] the speaker's ability to present
- [ ] how interesting the topic may be to club members

This step is not always necessary, but it is recommended to ensure that the session is engaging and informative.

### Prepare the Session

Once a presenter is found, have them prepare a presentation or discussion points. This can be a slide deck, a demo, or
a list of talking points. The presenter should also be prepared to answer questions from the audience.

On the day of the session, ensure that the presenter is ready to present. Make sure they have all the resources needed
for their presentation.

### Run the Session

After the first reading circle session, ensure that people gather near the round couches for the session. If the
session isn't well-attended, talk to members and encourage them to attend. Organizers should also feel free to attend
the session.

Ensure the session starts on time and that the presenter is ready to present. Make sure it doesn't run over the
allotted time, nor does it drag on if the presenter finishes early. Sometime in the middle of the session, the [Pizza](/events/hack-night/pizza.md)
should arrive, so ensure that the presenter is aware of this.

### Post Session

After the session, thank the presenter for their time and effort. If the session was well-received, consider having
them present again in the future. If there is outstanding reception, consider exploring a conversion to a
[Reading Circle](/events/hack-night/circles/README.md).
