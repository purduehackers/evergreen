# Setup

Setting up Hack Night is a crucial part of ensuring that the event runs smoothly. This guide will walk you through the
steps needed to set up Hack Night.

## Week Before

The week before Hack Night, the Events Division should ensure the Design team is ready to create the weekly badge for
Hack Night. A designer is tasked with coming up with a theme for the badge and creating a design. See [Badge](/design/badges/README.md)
for more information on this process.

The Events Division should also ensure that [Reading Circles](/events/hack-night/circles/README.md) are prepared for Hack Night and try
to find a facilitator for the session.

If there is a sponsor for the Hack Night, work with the [Fundraising](/comms/fundraising/README.md) team to plan
out the sponsor's involvement in the event, including an assets, presentations or sponsored activities.
