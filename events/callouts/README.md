# Callouts

Club callouts are events that are run at the beginning of each semester to
introduce new members to the club and to provide information on how to get
involved. They involve heavy marketing effort and are usually run in the first
few weeks of the semester.

## Fall Callouts

Fall callouts are our largest callouts of the year. We usually run them in
a large lecture hall on campus (e.g. MTHW 210).
