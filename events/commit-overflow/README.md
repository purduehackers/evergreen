# Commit Overflow

Commit Overflow is an event run during Winter break, during the second-to-last week of December. It lasts until the beginning
of Spring semester, the challenge being to commit for 10 days or more over Winter break.

Members who complete the challege will receive a special [Badge](../../design/badges/README.md) that says how many days
they committed. If they have a streak of 10 or more consecutive days, their badge will also list that information. Those
that commit every day until the semester starts will recieve a second extra special badge.

## Rules

- Each day starts at 6am (in the timezone of the member) and ends at 6am the next day.
- Every update must include a link or an attachment to something that was worked on.

## Logistics

An announcement will be made in [#announcements](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/809620019792707594)
(see [here](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/809620019792707594/1318970961487466496) for example) announcing
that Commit Overflow has started and linking to a new Forum channel in the Discord server. Members will be able to
create a thread for themselves and update it daily.

Closer to the end of the event, [Designers](../../design/README.md) will be tapped to create a badge for the event.

At the end of the event, the Events Division will review the threads and generate a list of members who have completed
the challenge successfully. They will note the number of days committed and the longest streak (for those who have a
streak of 10 or more days).

The badges will be generated with the help of the [Designers](../../design/README.md) and laser cut during the first
few weeks of the semester. Members will be able to pick up their badges at the first or second Hack Night of the semester.
