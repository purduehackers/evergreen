# Prep

Prep happens before a passport ceremony. You can do Prep in the [Knowledge Lab](https://lib.purdue.edu/knowledgelab/)
(third floor of WALC, to the left of the stairs). Prep usually takes 1-2 hours, depending on the number of
people attending the ceremony.

## Materials

Prior to Prep, ensure that you have sufficient amounts of the following materials:

- Faux Leather Roll
- Heat Transfer Gold Vinyl
- 12" x 12" Black Cardstock
- 8.5" x 11" Black Cardstock
- 8.5" x 11" Printer Paper
- 8.5" x 14" White Cardstock
- 8.5" x 11" 5mm Laminate Sheets
- 1/8" Clear Acrylic Block

If you need to do shopping, see [Resources](./resources.md).

## Leather Cutting

Cutting the faux leather is the first step in the Prep process. This is done to ensure that you have enough leather
for the number of participants attending the ceremony, as we easily run out of this material.

1. Go to the cutting-safe surface in the Knowledge Lab.
2. Roll out the faux leather on the table.
3. Place the 1/8" Clear Acrylic Block on a corner of the faux leather.
4. Use the X-Acto Knife to cut around the block.
5. Repeat this process until you have enough leather for the number of participants.

You should be able to cut two covers per row on the faux leather roll.

## Laminate + Cut Cards

Making the laminated cards is the second step in the Prep process. You will be laminating the 8.5" x 11" Black Cardstock
and then cutting it with the Cricut Maker 3.

1. Go to the laminating machine in the Knowledge Lab.
2. Turn on the laminator and set it to the ~~5mm~~ 3mm[^1] setting.
3. Place the 8.5" x 11" Black Cardstock in the laminating pouch.
4. Run the laminating pouch through the laminator, ensuring the sealed edge is facing the machine.
5. Repeat this process until you have enough sheets. Each sheet can make enough cards for two passports.

After laminating the cardstock, you will cut the cards with the Cricut Maker 3.

1. Go to the Cricut Maker 3 in the Knowledge Lab.
2. Power on the Cricut Maker 3 and connect it to your laptop.
3. Open the ["laminated cards"](https://design.cricut.com/landing/project-detail/65b1adf57814d93c7661d8aa) pattern in
   [Cricut Design Space](https://design.cricut.com/).
4. Select the "On Mat" option and continue to the next screen.
5. Make sure layout of the cards is 2x2. Sometimes the software will put them in a 2x3 layout, but this will overflow
   the mat. Drag the cards around until they fit in a 2x2 layout.
6. Connect to the Maker 3.
7. Select "Kraft Board" as the material.
8. Set the pressure to "More" and the number of passes to "1".
9. Place one laminated cardstock sheet on the Cricut mat.
10. Load the mat into the Cricut Maker 3 and press the flashing "C" button.
11. Wait for the Cricut Maker 3 to finish cutting the cards, then unload the mat.

You should now have four small laminated cards. If they are not cut properly, then take them off the mat and cut them
manually using an X-Acto Knife on a cutting-safe surface. Repeat this process until you have enough cards for the number
of participants.

## Cut the Cardstock Layer

Cutting the cardstock layer is the third step in the Prep process. You will be cutting the 12" x 12" Black Cardstock with
the Cricut Maker 3 to make the cardstock layer for the passport.

1. Go to the Cricut Maker 3 in the Knowledge Lab.
2. Power on the Cricut Maker 3 and connect it to your laptop.
3. Open the ["cardstock layers template"](https://design.cricut.com/landing/project-detail/65b13683ac4d171a1415fd32) in
   [Cricut Design Space](https://design.cricut.com/).
4. Select the "On Mat" option and continue to the next screen.
5. Connect to the Maker 3.
6. Select "Cardstock (for intricate cuts)" as the material.
7. Place one 12" x 12" Black Cardstock sheet on the Cricut mat.
8. Load the mat into the Cricut Maker 3 and press the flashing "C" button.
9. Wait for the Cricut Maker 3 to finish cutting the cardstock layer, then unload the mat.

You should now have one cardstock layer the same size as the faux leather cover. If there are excess pieces, then take
an X-Acto Knife and cut them off. Repeat this process until you have enough cardstock layers for the number of participants.

## Cut the Heat Transfer Vinyl

Cutting the heat transfer vinyl is the fourth step in the Prep process. You will be cutting the 8.5" x 11" Heat Transfer
Gold Vinyl with the Cricut Maker 3 to make the cover design for the passport.

1. Go to the Cricut Maker 3 in the Knowledge Lab.
2. Power on the Cricut Maker 3 and connect it to your laptop.
3. Open the ["final circle"](https://design.cricut.com/landing/project-detail/65b01499c0054073ce1e8c31) pattern in
   [Cricut Design Space](https://design.cricut.com/).
4. Select the "On Mat" option and continue to the next screen.
5. Connect to the Maker 3.
6. Select "Foil Iron-On" as the material.
7. Set this aside for now.
8. Grab a sheet of 8.5" x 11" Heat Transfer Gold Vinyl.
9. Use the Cricut Paper Trimmer to cut the vinyl to 8.5" x 11" to
10. Place the vinyl on the Cricut mat, with the shiny side down.
11. Load the mat into the Cricut Maker 3 and press the flashing "C" button.
12. Wait for the Cricut Maker 3 to finish cutting the design, then unload the mat.

You should now have one design cut out of the heat transfer vinyl. Repeat this process until you have enough designs for
the number of participants.

## Round the Corners

Rounding the corners is the fifth step in the Prep process. You will be rounding the corners of *everything* (faux leather,
cardstock layer, and laminate cards).

1. Go to the cutting-safe surface in the Knowledge Lab.
2. Grab the corner rounder.
3. Take an item (faux leather, cardstock layer, or laminate card) and place it in the corner rounder.
4. Use the `S` slot to round the corners.
5. Press down on the corner rounder to round the corner.
6. Repeat this process for all corners of all faux leather covers, cardstock layers, and laminate cards.

## Printables

Printing the data pages and stamp pages is the sixth step and final in the Prep process. You will be printing the data pages on
8.5" x 14" White Cardstock and the stamp pages on 8.5" x 11" Printer Paper.

1. Generate the data pages using the [Passport Concatenator](../../engineering/passports/pdf-concat/README.md).
2. Email the data pages and the stamp pages to yourself.
3. Go to the HP LaserJet Printer in the Knowledge Lab.
4. Log in to the printer using your Purdue email.
5. Download the data pages and the stamp pages from your email.
6. Load the 8.5" x 14" White Cardstock into the printer (ask the Knowledge Lab staff for help if needed).
7. Print the data pages.
8. Load the 8.5" x 11" Printer Paper into the printer (should be pre-loaded).
9. Print the stamp pages.

You should now have the data pages and stamp pages printed. Repeat this process until you have enough stamp pages for the
number of participants.

You should also cut the stamp pages ahead of time to save time during the ceremony. Grab an X-Acto Knife and ruler and
go to the cutting-safe surface in the Knowledge Lab.

1. Place a stamp page on the cutting-safe surface.
2. Use the ruler to align the X-Acto Knife.
3. Cut the stamp pages along the edges. Start with the short edges first, then the long edges.
4. Repeat this process for all stamp pages.
5. Round the corners of the stamp pages using the corner rounder (`S` slot).


[^1]: The Knowledge Lab currently has 3mm laminate sheets, so set the laminator to 3mm. If you have 5mm laminate sheets,
      or if the Knowledge Lab has 5mm laminate sheets in the future, set the laminator to 5mm.
