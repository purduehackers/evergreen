Setup in the kitchen area of the Bechtel Center. Clear the countertops of all supplies, including the badges and
any pizza boxes. Also clear a table nearby for the sewing machine.

Place the sewing machine on the cleared table. Ensure the sewing machine is plugged in and threaded with white thread.
Make sure the thread from both the need and the bobbin are pulled out and sticking out to the left of the sewing machine.
Make sure the width is set to 3 and the needle is set to straight stitch.

While setting up the sewing machine, place down newspapers along the countertop. This will prevent most damage and
residue from spilling on the countertop.

Place the heat press on the far end of the countertop near the outlet. The heat press should be plugged in and turned on.
Ensure the heat press is set to 255Â°F and 30 seconds so it has time to heat up.

Collect all the materials for each passport and place them in a bundle. Ensure each bundle has the following:

- [ ] Data page
- [ ] Stamp pages (x6)
- [ ] Leather cover
- [ ] Black laminate cards (x2)
- [ ] Black cardstock
- [ ] Vinyl logo

Once all bundles are created, set them aside to distribute to the participants.

Lastly, set out the book tape, XActo knives, rulers, and corner rounder on the countertop.
