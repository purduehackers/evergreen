organizer should be assigned to one of the following stations:

- Booklet Preparation (2 people)
- Sewing Machine (1 person)
- Heat Press (1 person)
- Glue and Press (1 person)

## Booklet Preparation

The first station is Booklet Preparation. This station is responsible for preparing the data page and the stamp pages
to be sewn into a booklet.

1. Ask all participants to take their data page out.
2. Cut out a strip of book tape an inch longer than the length of the data page and give it to the participants.
3. Demonstrate to the participants how to apply the book tape to the data page[^1].
4. Once the participants have applied the book tape, ask them to grab a ruler and an X-Acto knife.
5. Have the participants cut the data page along the edge of the printed page[^2].
6. Round the corners of the data page and the stamp pages using the corner rounder on the `S` setting.
7. Fold the data page and stamp pages in half, inward. Place each page inside the other such that the designs match.
8. Fold the black cardstock in half and place it on the back, wrapping all the other pages.

## Sewing Machine

The second station is the Sewing Machine. This station is responsible for sewing the data page and stamp pages into a
booklet. The sewing machine should be set up and ready to go before the event starts.

1. Ask the participants to bring their booklet to the sewing machine.
2. Place four wonder clips on each corner of the booklet to hold it in place.
3. Demonstrate how to operate the machine on a piece of scrap paper.
4. Have the participant learn by operating the machine on a piece of scrap paper.
5. Once the participant is comfortable, have them clamp the booklet into the machine.
6. Sew the booklet down the middle, to about 1/3 of the way down the booklet from the top.
7. Reverse the machine and sew back up to the top of the booklet.
8. Sew all the way down to the bottom of the booklet.
9. Reverse the machine and sew up to about 1/3 of the way up the booklet from the bottom.
10. Lift the needle and the foot and pull the booklet from the machine.
11. Cut the thread and remove any excess thread.

## Heat Press

The third station is the Heat Press. This station is responsible for pressing the vinyl logo onto the leather cover.

1. Give the participants a weeding tool.
2. Ask the participants to carefully weed the vinyl logo (shiny side down).
3. Once the logo is weeded, ask participant to pull the remaining vinyl background off the adhesive with their hands.
4. When all that's left is the logo and characters, ask the participants fold the leather cover in half.
5. Place the logo on the leather cover, centered on the front.
6. Place the stack on top of a piece of butcher paper.
7. Place another piece of butcher paper on top of the stack.
8. Grab the heat press and place it on top of the stack and press the green button to start the timer.
9. Once the timer is done, lift the heat press and remove the butcher paper.
10. CAREFULLY take the passport and place it on the countertop to cool.
11. Slowly peel the clear plastic off the logo. The logo should be stuck to the leather cover.
12. If the design isn't adhered to the leather, repeat the process at 15 seconds.

## Glue and Press

The fourth station is the Glue and Press. This station is responsible for gluing the black laminate cards and the booklet
to the leather cover.

1. Ask the participants to bring all their final materials.
2. Provide a clean piece of scrap paper to the participants.
3. Ask the participants to place the leather cover on the scrap paper.
4. Ask the participants to get a black laminate card.
5. Provide the participants with an NFC sticker and ask them to place it on the laminate card.
6. Provide the participants with a glue bottle and ask them to apply glue to the laminate card[^3] on the side with the NFC sticker.
7. Provide the participants with a piece of scrap cardstock and have them evenly spread the glue on the laminate card.
8. Ask the participants to place the laminate card on the inside of the leather cover, on the side with the logo.
9. Have the participants repeat steps 6-8 (without the NFC sticker) with the other laminate card.
10. Ensure both laminate cards are placed on the inside of the leather cover and aligned with the edges of the cover.
11. Have participants put glue on the top of the laminate cards and spread it evenly.
12. Ask the participants to place the booklet on top of the laminate cards, aligning the spine with the spine of the leather cover.
13. Ask the participants to press down on the booklet to ensure the glue adheres to the laminate cards.

## Activation

Immediately after the participant finishes glueing their passport, the organizer should activate their passport.

1. Take the passport from the participant and activate it using the [Passport Authority](/engineering/passports/authority/README.md).
2. Once the passport is activated, place it underneath a heavy surface (e.g. some books) and tell them to wait for one hour (or until they leave)
  before taking it out. This will ensure the glue has some time to dry. If the participant is leaving, tell them to place it
  under a heavy surface for at least 24 hours once they get home so the glue can fully dry.

[^1]: The book tape should be held as straight as you can. Carefully and slowly lay down the very top of the tape on the
      data page. Once the top is down, gently let the rest of the tape fall down. If done right, the tape should be on
      with no crinkles or bubbles. If you don't get it right, it's okay.
[^2]: The X-Acto knife should be held at a 45-degree angle to the paper. The ruler should be held down on the paper to
      ensure a straight cut. If the paper doesn't cut all the way, repeat the cut until the paper is cut through.
[^3]: The glue should be applied as a thin line in an `S` pattern or a thick line diagonally, such that there isn't too
      much glue on the card. If there is too much glue, card will slide around and the glue will seep out the sides or
      the booklet will stick together.
