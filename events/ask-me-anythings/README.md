# Ask-Me-Anythings

Ask-Me-Anythings (AMAs) are an event where a guest speaker is invited to talk to the Purdue Hackers community about their
experiences and answer questions. The event is typically held virtually. The speaker can be a professional in the tech
industry, a Purdue alumni, or anyone of particular interest to members.

In the past we have done an AMA with [Steve Wozniak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25RlBawQEb4)!

## Preparation

1. **Find someone cool!** Possibly someone already giving us money and someone people like!
2. **Reach out to them.** Find a way to contact them and ask if they would be interested in doing an AMA.
3. **Coordinate Time, Place, and Cost.** Reach out to the speaker and find a time that works for them. Figure out if
   we want an in-person venue (depending on the speaker). If the speaker is not local, figure out how much it will
   cost to have them speak and if we can afford it.
4. **Promote the event.** Make sure people know about the event! Post on social media, make a flyer, announce in the
   Discord server, etc.
5. **Create a Zoom link.** Make sure you have a Zoom link ready for the event. Share it with the speaker and make sure
   they know how to use it.

## Prior to the Event

Have a list of questions ready. Create a Discord channel for people to submit questions and hand-select people we want
to ask questions. This is to ensure that we only have high-quality questions and don't waste time. See [#🍎woz-ama](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/1230620279810560100)
for an example.

When you are ready to start the event, share the Zoom link in the Discord server and start recording the meeting. Ensure
that everyone is muted and that the speaker is the only one with their video on. This will ensure that the recording is
clean and that the speaker is the only one talking.

Optionally create a "day-of" schedule to ensure that everything goes smoothly. For example, see the
[Steve Wozniak Day-Of Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sTP2LHqpo0pL33XVSDuZ9TShoR4_M6KUsCu7h78ZLwE/edit?tab=t.0).

## During the Event

1. **Introduce the speaker.** Have 1-2 hosts who lead the discussion. The hosts should introduce Purdue Hackers, the
   speaker, and themselves. They should also ask the first question.
2. **Have an organizer DM the speaker.** Have an organizer DM the next person who will ask a question. Do this 1-2
   minutes before the current question is finished so they have time to prepare.
3. **Unmute a student.** Introduce the student and have them ask their question. Make sure they are unmuted and that
   their video is on. Make sure they are respectful and that they ask a good question, and that they don't take too
   long on follow-up questions.
4. **Repeat.** Repeat steps 2-3 until the list of questions is exhausted or the time is up.
5. *Optional.* If there is time left, open the floor to the audience for questions. Make sure to moderate the questions
   and ensure that they are respectful and relevant.
6. **End the event.** Thank the speaker for their time and end the meeting.
7. **Post the recording.** Download the recording and share it internally so it can be edited and posted on YouTube.

We should also be streaming the event to YouTube so that people who can't make it can still watch. This can be done by
using OBS Studio and streaming to the Purdue Hackers Youtube channel.

1. **Download OBS Studio.** Download OBS Studio from [obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com/).
2. **Set up OBS Studio.** Set up OBS Studio to stream to the Purdue Hackers YouTube channel. You will need to get the
   stream key from the YouTube channel settings.
3. **Start the stream.** Start the stream 5-10 minutes before the event starts to ensure that everything is working.\
   Navigate to `OBS -> Manage Broadcast -> Create Info` with the following information:
   - **Title:** Purdue Hackers - <Speaker Name> AMA
   - **Description:** Got Questions for <Speaker Name>? Send them in our Discord: puhack.horse/discord
   - **Privacy:** Unlisted or Public
   - **Category:** Science & Technology
   - Make sure to disable the chat and enable the recording.


## After the Event

1. **Edit the recording.** Edit the recording to remove any unnecessary parts (e.g. the beginning where people are
   joining the meeting).
2. **Post the recording.** Post the recording on YouTube and share it on social media.
3. *Optional.* Timestamp the recording. This can be done by adding timestamps to the video description or by using a
   tool like [youtubemark](https://youtubemark.com/).
4. **Thank the speaker.** Send a thank you email to the speaker and thank them for their time!! Also ask if they would
   be interested in joining our [VIP Newsletter](../../comms/outreach/vip-newsletter/README.md)
