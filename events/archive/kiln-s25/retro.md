# Kiln S25 Retro

## Overview

Kiln was a micro game jam hosted by Purdue Hackers from April 18–20, 2025. The 48-hour jam would have included creative activities, social events, and planned catering. Despite initial enthusiasm and decent turnout, several organizational issues affected the experience.

## The Good

- We secured a partnership with Wacom to provide prizes.
- We tried multiple new marketing strategies and gained valuable insights on their effectiveness:
  - Ran an effective poster campaign targeting students.
  - Used social media well, resulting in a greater reach.
  - Built a system to easily email professors who could promote the event to their students; this proved highly effective.
- We found Luma to be a better event management platform than our own events website. 
- Strong initial interest – 26 people signed up, 18 attended the kickoff.
- Six groups completed and presented games.
- The closing showcase was well-received and enjoyable for participants.
- Attendees reported having fun and making meaningful progress on creative projects.
- Participants self-organized at the PMU and Hillenbrand when access issues arose.
- Branding efforts went extremely well. Posters and tickets were well-thought out and widely distributed.
- The event served as a valuable stress test for our organizing and planning processes ahead of the Fall 2025 Show.

## The Bad

- The original date (April 11) was postponed due to:
  - Insufficient preparation progress.
  - Conflicts with another hackathon.
  - Poor communication between organizers and potential participants.
- The final date (April 18–20) overlapped with Easter, the end of Passover, and the academic end-of-semester crunch — all contributing to low attendance and organizer availability.
- Communication issues impacted the event at several points:
  - The theme ("Creaturas and Friendship") was only mentioned once and never repeated.
  - The Public Discord channel was created too close to the event and saw minimal use.
  - Critical updates (e.g., schedule changes, logistics) were not effectively communicated.
- Activities were not properly planned or executed, due to limited time and resources.
- There was no clear communication around cancelled events or delays in prize distribution. 
- There was no defined wrap-up plan or owner to drive event closure and follow-through.

## The Ugly

- Organizational Breakdown:
  - Of the 5–7 organizers or hack bishops initially interested, only 3 followed through with logistics work.
  - There was little accountability or follow-up on critical responsibilities.
  - Delays in execution were common, and unassigned tasks defaulted to a small subset of individuals.
  - There was an over-reliance on one person to pick up unhandled duties.
  - The event reinforced concerns among attendees that Purdue Hackers could not reliably follow through on commitments.
- Venue Failure:
  - A confirmed venue was not secured until the week of the event, which undermined motivation to organize and prepare. 
  - Initially, the event was to be hosted in DSAI. However, this presented more bureaucracy than expected.
    - We started having a conversation with them three weeks or so before the event by talking to the facilities supervisor Jay Senesac. We got him on board pretty quickly, but it wasn't his call to decide whether we could use the venue, so he offered to take it to the people higher up. 
    - There were lots of stipulations and restrictions, costs associated with janitorial fees, and bureaucratic processes we couldn't wait for.
    - DSAI is still a viable future venue for events; The College of Science is excited about the prospect of us hosting events in the space, we just need to start engaging with them a lot sooner.
  - Last-minute engagement with the Envision Center seemed promising, but the venue was ultimately unusable for most of the jam. 
    - There was no backup venue plan.
    - Time restrictions (no access from 0:00 to 6:00 in PMU/STEW) fragmented the event.
    - People repeatedly had problems entering the envision center due to lack of a full-time staff member.
      - This was made worse by the lack of communication. 
  - The last-minute switch to kick-off at Bechtel was poorly communicated:
    - Notification went out only via email and a paper sign posted at check-in time.
    - This resulted in confusion, missed attendance, and participants leaving after finding locked doors.
- Lack of Role Assignment and Responsibility:
  - No one was assigned to tasks like check-in, managing activities, or comms. 
  - Key roles (e.g., unlocking doors, monitoring Discord) were either unstaffed or staffed by unavailable people. 
  - Organizers defaulted to "whoever is around" filling roles ad hoc.

## Takeaways and Recommendations

- Start planning earlier. Secure the venue, set a date, and assign roles at least a month or two in advance. Late starts caused a chain of avoidable issues.
- Avoid organizing events in April. April is packed with holidays, finals, and burnout. Unless absolutely necessary, avoid this window or prepare accordingly.
- Always have a backup venue plan. If your first choice falls through, there should be a secondary venue lined up. The lack of a fallback worsened confusion and attendance drop-off.
- Communicate early, clearly, and frequently. Use multiple channels (email, Discord, printed signage) to keep attendees informed of updates, especially changes and logistics.
- Post and reinforce critical information. Logistics, schedules, and locations should be posted in obvious places and repeated often. Verbal announcements are not enough.
- Hold organizers accountable for specific tasks. Everyone involved in running the event should know what they're responsible for. Nothing should rely on volunteers stepping up in the moment.
- Create and maintain a public communication channel well before the event, and use it to actively answer questions, post updates, and share resources.
- Set a clear wrap-up timeline before the event starts. Communicate when the winners will be announced, when prizes will be delivered, and when post-event materials will be finalized.
- Keep events participant-centric. Many attendees had a good experience because they were adaptable. Don’t rely on that, structure and planning should support everyone, not just the resilient few.
- Ensure all external communications are properly documented. Emails should be sent from or CC’d to phackers@purdue.edu, and important messages (especially logistics or partnerships) should be screenshotted and shared in the comms channel for visibility.
- Hold organizers accountable for their commitments. If someone signs up to handle a task, follow up and verify progress. Don’t assume things will get done without check-ins.
- Make organizer participation more meaningful and inspiring. Help organizers understand the impact of their work, and give them ownership over parts of the event.
