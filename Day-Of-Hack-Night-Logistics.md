There are a handful of things that we did in preparation for and during hack night. This was written for running Hack Night in the second floor of the Bechtel Innovation Design Center.

## Materials & things to have

These are things you should make sure we have at Hack Night that are not already on the Hack Cart.

- Badges
- Stamp & stamp pad (for stamping passports)
- A device that can connect to the projector
- 2x HDMI cable
- USB-C to HDMI adapter (for midnight checkpoints and/or doorbell)

## General Timeline

### (Ideally) <8:00 PM
- [ ] Obtain Hack Cart from Lawson. This contains supplies and a handful of projects. You will need to use the elevators in both Lawson and Bechtel.
- [ ] Order pizza (see the other document in evergreen going over the details of that). Time may vary. The goal is for the pizza to arrive around 9pm, and delivery often takes 1.5-2h

### 8:00 PM
- [ ] Set up projector with the Hack Night Dashboard. We usually use Matthew's iPad but any spare device that can connect to the projector could work.
  - Make sure to test that the sound is working & at an appropriate volume by triggering the doorbell. Do not set up and leave without testing the doorbell.
    - If audio is not playing from the iPad, double check that it isn't muted and that the volume is on above 0.
- [ ] Set up Door Opener.
  - Wipe off suction cups with a damp paper towel as well as the spot on the wall where the Door Opener will be attached.
- [ ] Make sure weekly badges are out.
- [ ] Make sure weekly stamp is out along with the ink pad.
- [ ] Create a thread on discord to start tracking attendance.
  - Create a thread in the #core-hack-night channel called "MM/DD/YYYY Attendance" and do a head count around every hour.
- [ ] This would also be a good time to start taking pictures of hack night. They can be placed somewhere convenient in the Discord later on.

### ~9:00 PM
- [ ] Sessions and Reading Circle timeslots begin. They can occur whenever but generally start a bit into hack night, and generally are given single-hour increment blocks of time.
  - If this is the first edition of a Reading Circle, go around Hack Night telling people it's starting.

### ~10:00 PM 
- [ ] Pizza gets delivered.
  - [ ] Make sure there is enough counter space for the pizza.
  - [ ] Put plates/napkins out.
  - [ ] Enforce 2 slices per person, otherwise we will run out.
- [ ] Session timeslot begins. Let everybody at Hack Night know that a Session is beginning.

### 11:59 PM
- [ ] Countdown happens during approximately the last minute of Hack Night, using the Dashboard as the countdown timer.
- [ ] Gather people for the countdown.
- [ ] Prepare to lead directly into Checkpoints.

### 12:00 AM
- [ ] Checkpoints egin. Generally, people are given about 2 minutes to show what they are working on.

### ??:?? AM: Whenever hack night ends
Hack Night ends when the last person leaves. The way we counted if Hack Night was occurring was if 3 people were present, 2 of which at least must be awake. An approximate average time for Hack Night to end is around 6 AM, but that varies a lot.
- [ ] Throw away all pizza boxes into recycling bins.
  - [ ] It may help to break down the boxes first so that you can maximize recycling bin space.
- [ ] Put any tables and chairs back where they originally came from.
- [ ] Clean up any food, wrappers, plates, or napkins that may have been left on the floor.
- [ ] Check for any badges people might have left over. If you find any, put them back in the badge bag.
- [ ] Put badges back on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Put stamp stuff back away on the Hack Cart.
- [ ] Put away any Passport making things on the Hack Cart.
  - [ ] If there is any trash leftover from making passports, throw it away.
- [ ] Put door opener away onto Hack Cart.
- [ ] Unplug device from projector that has the dashboard, put it away.
- [ ] Put away any other Purdue Hackers projects back onto the Hack Cart as well (assuming the project was being stored there).
- [ ] Take Hack Cart back to the Purdue Hackers office in Lawson.
