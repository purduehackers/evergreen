# Hack Bishops

Hack Bishops are pseudo-organizers who help out with the club's operations. They are not obligated to attend meetings
nor are they required to work on any specific project. They are just individuals who are excited about the club and want
to help out in any way they can!

> Hack Bishops often end up becoming full-fledged organizers, but that's not an expectation.

Hack Bishops have access to all our internal channels and are encouraged to participate in discussions and help out with
projects. They are also encouraged to attend all-hands meetings and provide feedback on the club's operations.
