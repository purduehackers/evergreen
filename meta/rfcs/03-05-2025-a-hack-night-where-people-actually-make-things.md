# A hack night where people actually make things

*March 25th, 2025*

I am so proud of how far Hack Night has come since its inception on September 16th, 2022. It’s so absurdly cool that _every single week_ we gather 80 people on the second floor of an awesome makerspace, manufacture badge collectibles to hand out, install doohickeys like the Sign, Door Opener, Phone Bells, and passports—and we’ve never missed a week. Checkpoints is the best new addition to Hack Night, finally allowing dozens of people every week to share what they’ve been working on with everyone else.

Despite this, I currently believe Hack Night is not living up to its vision and full potential. In this document, I would like to propose some changes to the structure of Hack Night which I hope will realign it toward better outcomes.

I would like these ideas to be the foundation for Hack Night 6.0, which will kick off with the Fall 2025 semester, but I want to begin implementing them now. Kind of like how Hack Night 4.0 came about, with many of its ideas actually landing before 4.0 proper.

## The problem: Hack Night has lost important background context that it’s a space for making things

The initial goal of Hack Night was to bring people together on Friday night to make things together. In reality, Hack Night has never served this purpose. During the WALC trenches era, people occasionally worked on projects but they mostly either hung out or did homework. At the time I was desperate to keep people in the room, so I didn’t care what people did as long as they showed up.

As Hack Night grew to 30 people, moved into the Bechtel Center, then kicked off the Fall 2023 semester with over 100 people (eventually stabilizing to an average of 80), I had given up on the idea that Hack Night could actually be a productive coworking event. I personally could not focus on a project at Hack Night because I found it much more compelling to talk to people. I also felt that if someone really wanted to be productive, nothing could beat locking in alone in a room, so Hack Night worked better as a social event anyway. During Hack Night 4.x and 5.x, its purpose became solidified as a social hangout event with optional check-ins for projects made in the past week (usually outside of Hack Night).

I still agree with most of these ideas, but I no longer agree that Hack Night can’t be a space where people actually make things.

From Hack Night 0.x to 2.x (AKA when Hack Night had 5-30 people), I would regularly walk around, start conversations with every attendee, and ask them what they were making. If they weren’t working on something, I would do my best to help them. (I would rarely succeed, but I would always put in the effort.) I began doing this less during Hack Night 3.x and had stopped entirely after 4.x. In retrospect, I think this was important for establishing a background context that Hack Night is for making things. I distinctly remember that people used to feel like they’re “failing” Hack Night if they weren’t “being productive”. I didn’t want people to feel that way, so I stressed that they didn’t need to be productive. Today, I get the impression that people don’t feel this way anymore. But I’m not sure it’s been a net positive.

There were never any glory days when everyone at Hack Night was “being productive”. But I feel like the *vibe of making* that once made up the background context of Hack Night is no longer a part of Hack Night. I think this background context was important because it established [a Current](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/galactic-empire#:~:text=The%20Fire%20%26%20the%20Current) that pushed people toward making something, which was a good thing even if it was a relatively weak one that only worked for ~20% of attendees.

Without this background context, almost everyone who comes to Hack Night today is doing homework or playing video games. Very little output is produced at Hack Night; interesting projects are regularly shared at Checkpoints, but they are almost always made outside of Hack Night and thus don’t contribute to the atmosphere of Hack Night outside of Checkpoints.

Homework and video games have always been a part of Hack Night. What I feel has changed is that people used to feel a twinge of guilt for doing so, as if they were not accomplishing their goals for Hack Night; today, they do so shamelessly, and assert their right to do so, as for many of them the purpose of Hack Night has never been to actually make anything.

This is not the atmosphere I want at Hack Night. I started Hack Night because I wanted to be surrounded by best-in-class engineers and creatives across many domains, who were pushing me to do my best work. Today, I don’t feel like this is the case. But I think it can be.

Ray has mentioned on multiple occasions that his favorite Hack Night was his very first, the “secret hack night” the week before Hack Night 5.0. When asked why, he mentions the smaller crowd, people talking to each other and welcoming him in, and the cool projects being actively worked on in the open. We should learn from this.

To be clear, I don’t think we should delude ourselves into believing it’s possible for every Hack Night attendee to “be productive” at Hack Night. I just think we need to bring back the background context that Hack Night is for making things.

## The proposal

5 parts:

### Start asking people what they’re working on again

This was a highly underrated part of early Hack Night that we should bring back. It’s especially important for newcomers, many of whom are looking to talk to new people, but I think we should set a norm of asking everyone, including regulars, what they’re working on. Initially, this should be led by Organizers and Hack Bishops, who make the rounds roughly every lightning time bolt until Checkpoints.

These rounds give regular opportunities for people to ask questions, which they are less likely to do without prompting but are important for orientation. More importantly, it frames conversations around what people are making, which contributes toward re-establishing the background context.

### Ban homework and video games, and actually enforce it

Hack Night attendees need to feel guilty when they play video games or do homework. We need to make it clear to them, repeatedly, that these activities are not what Hack Night is for.

Every Hack Night announcement from here on out should include “no homework or video games”, and organizers should kindly encourage people who they see doing these activities at Hack Night to do something else. We don’t need to be very persistent: all that’s necessary is making them feel aware of and guilty about it, which only requires one friendly and no-big-deal-vibed interaction.

The regular rounds of asking people what they’re working on can double as the enforcement mechanism. This way, the interactions start with a positive context, since the goal of those who participate in the rounds is to start conversations with people, not police their activities.

Unfortunately, the time to make this change seamlessly was Fall 2023. Today, as mentioned earlier, the purpose of Hack Night for many regulars _is_ an accountability space for homework, or a relaxing game break hangout with friends. We should expect the average Hack Night attendance to drop as some of these people stop coming, and be okay with that.

People will give all kinds of reasons for why they must do homework at Hack Night. They are wrong—or, rather, they are right only because the Current of homework is stronger than the Current of making things. Hack Night was founded because _making things is hard_: it will always be easier to do homework because homework has a clearly-defined goal and sense of urgency, whereas making things feels optional, requires creativity, and has no external deadline. Hack Night has a responsibility to make the Current of making things stronger than the Current of homework: being at Hack Night should push you toward making creative _extracurricular_ projects and/or having inspiring conversations with friendly and talented people, so strongly that it takes great effort to do anything other than that. This version of Hack Night is what makes it unique and life-changing; a glorified study hall makes it neither. Let’s choose the unique and life-changing path.

Of course, banning homework on its own is not a solution, since the prevalence of homework at Hack Night is a symptom of a culture problem rather than the root. Establishing the right Current requires creating easy alternatives to homework and video games. But we also need to set the expectations we want from Hack Night, and that means explicitly discouraging the easier, toxic activities that people default to, and communicating that clearly.

### Establish a “host mindset”, or collective ownership over Hack Night

One thing Socratica gets extremely right is their “host mindset”: by coming to a Socratica session, you are expected to contribute to the event by cleaning up after yourself, helping with event operations where needed, and making newcomers feel included. This is drilled into them; they even recite a “host pledge”:

> I, \<insert name here\>, solemnly swear to adopt a host mindset for the duration of this event. I will NOT be a menace. I will clean up my own garbage and the occasional additional cup. And most importantly, if I see someone standing alone in the corner, I will go be their friend.

I am not suggesting introducing a host pledge. But I think we can learn something from the way they approach collective ownership. From [their Toolbox](https://toolbox.socratica.info/basics):

> “Everyone is a host” - Environments get better when everyone feels responsible for making things enjoyable. Some people even feel more comfortable when they feel like they have a little role. Give everyone a chance to be responsible!

In theory, we already sort of do this: anyone at Hack Night is allowed and encouraged to help out, and we crown those who _really_ want to help out as Hack Bishops, who we sometimes explicitly call on for support. But this still creates a hierarchy that limits responsibility to a small subset of Hack Night, even if we don’t intend it to.

Today, most Hack Night attendees do not feel responsible for making things enjoyable. Hack Night is a built environment that exists _for_ them: the door opener, Sign, and dashboard come up, pizza arrives, events happen, and they get to use all of it. This means I’m usually the person who scrambles to set everything up at 8pm, after I or one of 4-5 people bring the Hack Cart. During cleanup, we see lots of plates and cups left over, chairs moved all across the 2nd floor, and mice and keyboards unplugged. These are cleaned up by me and a few others who are dead-tired at 4am.

More people get the doorbell when it rings, but this should be something everyone is trained to do. Pizza is brought up by Josh or me, but we should be able to recruit any random person to help. Attendance checks and images should be taken by everybody, not a subset of organizers.

But most importantly, social acts like the “What are you making?” rounds should be something every attendee does. “What are you making?” should be the first question everyone asks someone they’re meeting for the first time, and everyone should feel a shared responsibility to start conversations with unfamiliar people. Organizers & Bishops should not be the only people making these rounds. Turn your social battery on.

This is harder than the rest to implement because the goals are less clear. “Establishing a host mindset” feels like a vague cultural change that is hard to make.

I plan to begin by drilling this idea into Organizers and Hack Bishops, and make every Organizer who comes to Hack Night feel responsible for helping run it, even if they’re not on the Hack Night project. I also want to drill this into new attendees when explaining for the first time what Hack Night does, or during the rounds. Basically I think the best way to make it real is to repeat it over and over as a core tenet of Hack Night. I think we will see the effectiveness of this in the fall, when we get an influx of new members who don’t have preconceived notions of what they should be doing at Hack Night.

### End Hack Night at 2:00am and establish an afterparty

It’s time to end the longstanding tradition of Hack Night ending “when the last person leaves”. This is a great marketing line, but in reality nothing good happens after 2:00am. Late-night Hack Night consists of meandering conversations and decreasing willpower as folks become increasingly tired, and a dreadful cleanup and teardown process. It also leaves the grueling job of returning the Hack Cart to the dead-tired last people to leave at 6am. And there’s nothing to show for it: this meaningless endurance test produces no work and ruins the Saturdays of its participants.

Let’s be honest with ourselves that 2:00am is and has always been the actual end to Hack Night, as folks wrap up their actual work and most begin to leave. Knowing this, let’s begin cleaning up at 2:00am and returning the cart immediately afterwards. Anyone is welcome to stay after 2:00am, like always, but this post-2am Hack Night will be known as the “afterparty”.

This afterparty does not have to be lame; much of the best Hack Night lore happens late at night, and it can often be a magical time. We should encourage afterparty attendees to organize their own activities and create their own magic. But for the sake of a less-dreadful cleanup and Hack Cart return, and the Saturdays of regulars, Hack Night proper should end at 2:00am.

### Cut pizza, then make it a post-Checkpoints activity

Pizza is by far our largest expense and also currently provides the least value. Pizza used to arrive around 10pm, which provided a great mid–Hack Night break that brought everyone together from different corners of the venue. But then we started running Sessions every week, then Circles, and there stopped being a good time to deliver pizza because it would eat into someone’s event. Today pizza arrives between 8:00 and 8:30pm, before most people arrive, so it provides far less value but is still expensive.

Lately we’ve taken steps to reduce the cost of pizza, but over the year we’ve spent ~$120 on pizza on average per Hack Night. This means that for the cost of 2 Hack Night pizzas, we could fund one microgrant project for a semester, and for the cost of 5, we could fund 3. That’s a lot of money that could instead be going directly to projects that add to Hack Night’s atmosphere & the Show. If we’re going to keep such a large expense, we need to make it more valuable.

To me it makes a lot more sense for pizza to be a post-Checkpoints activity. We can order less since there are fewer people, it’s a way to bring everyone together one final time to discuss Checkpoints before the end of Hack Night, and it introduces a “midnight snack” to Hack Night, which encourages people to stay later.

Let’s start by not ordering pizza this week to remove the expectation that there is pizza at Hack Night. Then, next week, let’s quietly order a few pizzas to be delivered at 12:15am, and end Checkpoints with a pizza announcement. We’ll see how people respond.

Let’s also revisit this in the future. Pizza is expensive and it really needs to be providing value to Hack Night. If we make it a post-Checkpoints activity and we still can’t articulate its value after a few weeks, let’s cut pizza altogether.

## Conclusion

This has been marinating for a while. I’m writing this down now for the first time. (If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.) This document is my way of structuring my thoughts for the first time and may contain incorrect opinions. Please start a thread and share your thoughts on these proposals. Think of it like an RFC, not a proclamation.

I would like to begin this week, but will not move forward without making sure people feel heard first.
