# Kiln 2025 retrospective

*May 1st, 2025, written by Cynthia Clementine*

Kiln was a micro game jam hosted by Purdue Hackers that was hosted April 18-20th. The jam ran for 48 hours, starting Friday at 20:00 and running to Sunday at 20:00. There were a multitude of activities planned, including icebreakers, a session of late-night laser tag, and an arts-and-crafts session. There were to be catering services for between two and four meals over the course of the weekend. Our designers made posters for the event, and a nice ticket people could pick up. 

26 people signed up for the [event on luma](https://lu.ma/fay4aj3t), of which 18 people showed up to the kick-off Friday night. All in all, there were six groups that finished games and presented at the closing ceremony. Almost<sup>1</sup> all games can be found [here](https://kiln-2025.devpost.com/project-gallery). It was a pretty small game jam, but such is to be expected considering timing. At the end of the semester, not many people are around to make games anyways.

After the game jam, judges decided on which ones were the best in a set of 4 categories, and winners were announced on the following Friday. We managed to partner with Wacom, and so were able to hand out drawing tablets as a prize to the top group<sup>2</sup>.

Now. If I wanted to brag, or I was talking to our lovely shareholders, that is about all I would want to say. Everyone I've talked to who wasn't a part of Kiln this year said they thought it went well, which means at the very least our image seems to have been preserved. However, this description of the event would leave all the issues out. So here are the issues. 



## The issues

### Timing 

The jam was initially planned to happen a week earlier, on April 11th. Unfortunately, ML@purdue was hosting their own hackathon that weekend. Hosting a game jame would most certainly split people, and given that they had already released advertising for it two weeks prior, it would probably be a bad move to host our game jam the same weekend. So Kiln was moved to April 18th.

The weekend of April 18th this year managed to conflict with both Easter and the end of Passover. The conflict with Easter, at least, had been discussed as a possible issue, but we decided to go ahead with it anyways, because we worried about running out of time in the semester. After all, the next weekend would be right before dead week, and then the weekend after that would be finals, and then summer break. None of those are really good times to host a game jam, so the weekend of the 18th it was. 

This decision almost certainly knocked out a good chunk of people that would have otherwise come to the event. Campus was noticably emptier, and it reduced the number of organizers we had available to help. 

Luckily both Easter and Passover move around relative to the standard calendar (next year Easter is on April 5th, and the end of Passover on April 9th), so this exact problem will not happen again, but similar problems are likely. 


### Venue

If we wanted people to actually show up to a weekend-long event, the venue would have to be somewhere on campus. Unfortunately, most locations on campus are closed at some point over the weekend. The Bechtel center closes on Saturday, which makes it unsuitable for hosting a multi-day event such as this one.

The other good option would have been the DSAI building, but hosting an event in there entails a much longer bureaucratic process. We would have to fill out an APF, SAO would have to be contacted to make Kiln a Registered Event, we would have to choose from the list of Approved Caterers, which would limit our options, etc. Overall, far too many acronyms and proper nouns for a quick event like this one.

The envision center seemed to be the next good location. Purdue Hackers has multiple members that are currently envision center staff, so we have a good relationship. As a result the envision center was chosen for the event. It's by the PMU, it seemed like an ok idea. With the benefit of hindsight I can pretty confidently say the envision center is a terrible venue.

The envision center (EC) is underground, and therefore difficult to find. It locks 24/7, meaning you need to constantly have an employee letting people in. Staff is extremely serious about this. Unlike the Bechtel center, where you can just wait for someone to walk in or out, EC staff makes sure to pull the door closed behind them to prevent you from walking in.

Due to the problem of the locked EC, the game jam was changed to start in the Bechtel center Friday night. However, this was after all the posters had been sent out, and the tickets printed, so the only way people were notified was via email. This resulted in a bunch of people just not showing up to the start of the event, or showing up late. We printed a quick sign informing people of the change, and put it up on the EC doors, but this was only done at 20:00, after check-in started. This meant that some people showed up to the EC and then left without realizing the venue had changed. 

The idea was that, because two Purdue Hackers members are EC employees, we would always be able to let people in. However, this compounded with the aforementioned timing issue, and both members had commitments that made them unavailable for most of the weekend. As a result, everyone who wanted to get into the EC was unable to, and resorted to sitting outside the doors or at one of the various locations nearby.


### Communication (and lack thereof)

There was so much not communicated with the general public, and that eroded a ton of people's trust in the event.

There was a theme: Creaturas and Friendship. This theme was verbally told to people once, at the kickoff event, and then never mentioned again until the end of the jam. As a result, many people did not hear this theme, or did not even know there *was* a theme. A single slide put up on the screen, even, with the theme would have been nice. 
I remember a moment approximately 30 hours into this 48 hour game jam, this incredible exchange occurred:

>Yeah, so I took the theme rather literally.

>There's a theme?

People didn't know about the theme. Even people who thought they knew about the theme didn't know about the theme, autocorrecting it to either creaturas or friendship, rather than both. 

The theme of a game jam is extremely important, because it dictates the types of games people (should) be making. So the fact that many of the participants did not even know there was one is a gigantic blunder. It is also illustrative of the scale of the communication problems behind this jam.

There were two discord channels dedicated to Kiln; one for organizer planning, and one for the general public to see. While the planning one remained active, the public one wasn't even created until a few days before the event, and communication didn't happen much, if at all, in that channel. On Friday night, only one person sent messages there, and none of them contained information about the jam. The theme was not posted there, although it could have been. No information to do with activities or catering was posted there. This is another collossal failure of communication. If the public Kiln channel was not to communicate information or talk about the jam, what was it for?

Multiple people used the public channel to request being let into the EC over the course of the weekend. None of them were. None of them were informed that this was not a thing Purdue Hackers actually had the power to do, because the conversation would typically go 

> "Hey, can I be let into the EC please?"

> "Sure!" (pings EC employee that is unavailable)

> The conversation ends and the result is never spoken of.

This exact repeated sequence gave the impression people were being let in, when none of them actually were. 

Almost none of the events listed on the ticket actually happened. No announcements were sent out about their cancellation, the time for them just quietly passed. 

This is bad. I don't know how to effectively communicate how bad it is. This sequence shook many people's faith in Purdue Hackers, and the ability for us to follow-through on the things we say. 

This could have been avoided if people were actually assigned to organizing for the event and completing tasks. 


### Organizing

I didn't really participate in the organizing process that much. I contributed opinions every once in a while, but mostly I just participated in the jam. Probably my biggest contribution was checking people into the jam when it started on Friday night. However, the way I got put into that position was just kind of by being there. Ray said to me, "We need somebody to check people in, I've just been doing it by myself from my phone," and I said "Oh, I can do that," and then I did that for the next hour. 

Why was nobody assigned to this ahead of time? Why was nobody assigned to anything ahead of time? Did we really not have anyone available to do these things? Ray mentioned that he felt like he was the only organizer available to actually structure the jam, since a bunch of other people wanted to participate rather than organize. This should not have been the case.

This semester, we had 14 organizers officially available. Of those, three (3) declared interest in participating in the game jam. This is unacceptable. We need to be able to run an event even if a few organizers are unavailable. 

[this is where the comments of an actual organizer would probably be more helpful. I'm not super confident in talking about organizing, because I'm not sure exactly what communication, if any, happened in terms of assigning people.]



## TLDR, a.k.a. How to do better

* In terms of scheduling: Take note! April is a difficult month both to plan and host events in. People are busy with the end-of-semester crunch, and it already shares a lot of time with holidays, or other Purdue events. It isn't a hard and fast rule to not plan anything for April, but at the very least, double-check all your plans and assign more people to organizing than you think will be necessary.

* Do not host an event in the envision center. Don't do it. You may think it's a good idea, but that would be the devil talking. 

* Make as much information as possible accessible in multiple different places. Or really just any place. There was an event page on Luma: use that to email people with updates, **frequent updates**, as they happen. Post the same information on discord. Pin it, because manually scrolling through a discord conversation for critical information is difficult<sup>3</sup>. People should be able to easily find the most up-to-date information about the jam without having to ask a person in real-time. 

* Assign organizers to specific tasks and then check in frequently about whether those tasks can be completed. Reassign people if they aren't available. An activity will not happen on its own<sup>4</sup>, so at least one person needs to make sure that it happens. That person needs to actually be available over the course of the event.

* This is important! Talk to the general public about events and updates as they happen. Notify people about when the jam starts, what the theme is, what activities are happening or not happening. Sure, don't overload people with unnecessary announcements before the jam, but once the event itself has started, people are basically locked in. The downside to sending out a bunch of announcements (slight annoyance), is far better than the downside to not sending out any (nobody shows up to the activities).

* Establish a time-frame for finishing the event quickly and stick to it. As of writing, it has been two weeks since the end of the jam, and one week since winners were announced. This would be more fine if a time-frame were established beforehand, rather than the air of mystery we currently have around when Kiln will actually be completely over.



## footnotes

1. My game isn't in here because I got banned from devpost as soon as I submitted it. As a result it got removed from the public list. Oh well. 

2. As of writing this, I think we still haven't done this. Add that to the list of things we didn't do quite right.

3. I know this because I had to scroll through the Kiln organizing channel to find timing and decision-making information. It wasn't particularly fun.

4. Saturday evening, two groups worked together in the PMU. On Sunday, after showing up to the envision center (and being locked out), I joined up with a few other people, we went to Hillenbrand, and all in all got together a group of 6 people working on a few different games. So that was essentially the entire in-person game jam component. The point is that spontaneous shenanigans may occur without planning.
