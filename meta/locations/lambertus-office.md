# Lambertus Office

The Lambertus Office is located at 363 Grant St, West Lafayette, IN 47907. The office is located on the first
floor, Room 1240.

We don't fully own the space, as it is used by corporate partners for interviews. They generally use the room Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday, and they're usually out by the afternoon. We will usually be emailed if they have to use the
room for longer. We have a few desks (with one swivel chair and two standalone) and a whiteboard.

We also have a cabinet that we can use to store our items long-term, since we aren't allowed to put items on the desk.
We may be able to put smaller acrylic sheets in it.

To get access to the office, you will need to contact [@Phineas1500](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/phineas1500.md)
to put in a request for ID card access on your behalf. The office is accessible until 9pm with your ID (so long as the
building is open).
