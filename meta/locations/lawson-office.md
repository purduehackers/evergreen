# Lawson Office

The Lawson Office is located at 305 N. University St. West Lafayette, IN 47907. The office is located on the Basement
floor, Room B128.

The office is currently co-habitated with the [Purdue Linux Users Group (PLUG)](https://purduelug.org/). We share
the space with them and have a few desks and a whiteboard.

The office currently has the [Hack Cart](/events/hack-night/hack-cart.md) and some of our older items
that are not currently in use. The office is open to all members of the organization and is a quiet space to work.

To get access to the office, you will need to contact [@infinidoge](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/infinidoge.md)
to put in a request for a keyfob on your behalf. The office is accessible 24/7 with your keyfob (so long as the
building is open).

## Provisioning Access

An individual (usually [@infinidoge](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/infinidoge.md))
representing Purdue Hackers can go through the following steps to provision someone access to the office:

1. Double-check that the individual has been given permissions to request a keyfob.
2. DM the individual to ask for their full name and Purdue email address.
3. Email `workstudy@cs.purdue.edu` with the individual's name and Purdue email address information requesting a
   keyfob to Lawson B128 (TODO(@infinidoge): add email template).
4. Let the individual know that they should expect a message from the CS department to pick up their keyfob.
5. Once the individual has picked up their keyfob, add them to the access list above.

Optionally, any organizer can help create an ID keycard for the individual to use to access the office. This can be
done with the following steps:
