# Contact Collection Letter

These are templates to collect contact information from new organizers
and Hack Bishops. This information will be added to [purduehackers/dark-forest](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest)
to help us keep track of who's who in the club and make it easier for
other members to reach!

## Organizer Contact Collection Letter

````markdown
Heya!!

We're super excited to have you on board as an organizer for Purdue Hackers!

We generally ask all organizers for some contact information so we can easily
reach out to you if ever needed outside Discord. This information will be
stored in a private repository on Github and only be accessible to Organizers
and Hack Bishops.

This is an example of what a file in dark-forest would look like:

```markdown
# rayhanadev

- Preferred Name: Ray
- Pronouns: he/they
- Primary Division: Events
- Graduation: Spring 2028

## Contacts

| Phone     | (817) 470-7345      |
| Website   | -                   |

Items marked with an asterisk (*) are required for all organizers and project owners.
```

When you get a chance, please let me know the following information:
