# Recruiting

This document should serve as a guide to recruiting new organizers for Purdue
Hackers. It outlines the process of identifying potential candidates, reaching
out to them, and onboarding them into the club.

## Identifying Candidates

First you will need to determine what positions need to be filled. Consult with
the division lead or the club president to determine whether we need to invite
a new organizer to fill a specific role or if someone who is already an organizer
can take on the role.

Once you have identified what role needs to be filled, you can start looking for
potential candidates. The decision to invite someone from the club to become
an organizer or to search externally for candidates will depend on the role. If a
candidate at Hack Night has shown interest in helping out with the club (e.g. a
current Hack Bishop or a regular attendee), then add them to the candidate pool.
If the role requires a specific skill set that is not present in the club, then
you may need to look externally.

When looking for external candidates, you can post on the club's social media
channels. Use the phrasing:

> We're looking for a new `role` to help out at Purdue Hackers (the largest
> CS Club at Purdue)! If you have `x`, `y`, `z` skills and are interested in
> creative-technical communities then you should reach out to us for more
> information!

Once you have a list of potential candidates, you can start reaching out to them.

## Reaching Out

When reaching out to potential candidates, it is important to be clear about what
the role entails and what is expected of them. You should also be prepared to
answer any questions they may have about the role or the club. It is important
to make sure that the candidate is a good fit for the role and that they are excited
about the opportunity to help out with the club.

Schedule a meeting with the candidate to discuss the role and their interest in
helping out with the club. Ideally, this meeting should take place at an informal
time during Hack Night. **DO NOT DISCUSS THE ROLE OVER TEXT OR EMAIL**. It is
important to have a face-to-face conversation with the candidate to gauge their
interest and see if they are a good culture fit.

## Interviewing

When you meet the candidate at Hack Night, you should introduce yourself and Purdue
Hackers. Invite them to an office room or a quiet area where you can conduct the
interview. It should be framed as a casual conversation to get to know the candidate
better and to see if they are a good fit for the role.

During the interview, you should ask the candidate about their background, their
interests, and why they want to help out with the club. Ask questions about their
experience and how they think they can contribute to the club. Real questions that
are applicable to the club are also good to ask (e.g. "We are working on solving `x`
problem, how would you approach it?").

Answer any questions the candidate may have about the club or the role. Be honest
about the expectations and the time commitment required for the role (emphasize that
it is important to attend all-hands meetings and be as attentive at Hack Night as
possible).

Also gauge whether they are a good culture fit for the club. If they seem like they would
match the energy and enthusiasm of other organizers and members, then they may be a good
fit for the role.

## Background Check

We don't conduct formal background checks on potential organizers, but it is important to
make sure that the candidate is actually a good person. You can ask around the club to see
if anyone knows the candidate and can vouch for them. If you have any concerns about the
candidate, then it may be best to not invite them to become an organizer or to have a
proper investigation conducted.

Also for any official positions for SAO (e.g. President, Treasurer) ensure that the candidate
is not on academic probation or has any other issues that would prevent them from holding
the position. If they are, then they may not be able to hold the position.

## Narrowing the Candidate Pool

After all the interviews have been conducted, you should have a good idea of who would be
a good fit for the role. You should narrow down the candidate pool to a few candidates who
you think would be the best fit for the role. Then, you can discuss with the division lead
and the club president to determine who should be offered the role. It is important to
consider the candidate's experience, enthusiasm, and culture fit when making this decision.

## Offering the Role

Once you have decided on a candidate, you can offer them the role. You should reach out to them
and let them know that they have been selected to become an organizer. You should also provide
them with information on what the role entails and what is expected of them. Make sure to answer
any questions they may have about the role or the club.

If the candidate accepts the role, then you can start the onboarding process. If they decline,
then you can reach out to the next candidate in the pool and offer them the role.

## Onboarding

Refer to the [Onboarding](/meta/resources/onboarding.md) guide for information on how to onboard
new organizers. Make sure to provide the new organizer with all the information they need to get
started and to help them get up to speed with the club's operations.
