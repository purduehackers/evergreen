# Onboarding

Welcome to Purdue Hackers (again)! We're excited for you to help us out more closely, and we hope you're excited to get
started!! This document will help you get up to speed with the club and its operations. If you have any questions, feel
free to reach out to any of the club organizers or the person who referred you to this document :)

## Who We Are

You've surely been around the club for a while, maybe even attended a few meetings or Hack Nights! We're a student-run
organization at Purdue University that aims to foster a community of hackers, makers, and tech enthusiasts. We host
workshops, hackathons, and other events to help students learn new skills, build cool projects, and meet like-minded
individuals.

## Club Structure

Purdue Hackers is very much a community-driven organization. You will always be responsible for a project you're
owning or helping out with, and you'll be working with others to help make the club better! We have [Divisions](/meta/structure/divisions.md)
that are helpful in organizing the club's operations and making sure everything runs smoothly, but you're not limited to
just one division! You are encouraged to help out in any way you can.

## Getting Started

To get started, you should first reach out to the organizer that added you. They'll be able to provide you with more
information how you'll be contributing. They'll also be able to answer any questions you have, help you get up to speed
with the club, and walk you through the onboarding process.

### Access to Discord Server

Make sure you have access to the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/BN2Avz35). You should have given access to our
internal channels by an organizer, however, if they haven't, please reach out to an organizer and ask for the `@Organizer`
role.

Once you have access to all of the club's channels, make sure to say hi in the [#core](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/890595036855685181)
channel! :)

### Access to Github Organization

Also make sure you have access to the club's [GitHub organization](https://github.com/purduehackers). You will need to be
assigned to the `Organizers` team to access the club's repositories. If you don't have access, ask in the [#core](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/890595036855685181)
channel and an organizer will help you out.

### Access to Google Drive

Lastly, make sure you have access to the club's Google Drive. You should have received an invitation to the club's Google
Drive when you were added to our internal channels. If you don't have access, please ask in the [#core](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/890595036855685181)
channel and an organizer will help you out.

### Add Contact Information

Create a branch on [purduehackers/dark-forest](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest) repository and use the template to
add yourself to the `people` directory. This will help us keep track of who's who in the club and make it easier for other members
to reach out to you!

### Access to Figma Organization (Optional)

If you need access to the Figma organization as a designer, please reach out the Design Lead (reach out to [Matthew](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/hewillyeah.md)
as we're in the process of getting a new Design Lead).

### Access to Purdue Hackers Office (Optional)

If you need access to the Lawson Office, where materials such as the [Hack Cart](/events/hack-night/hack-cart)
are stored, please ask in the [#office-and-inventory](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/1330647820960530464) channel
and ping [@infinidoge](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/infinidoge.md) or [Ray](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/rayhanadev.md)
to get added to the access list.

### Access to Vaultwarden (Optional)

If you need access to the club's password manager, Vaultwarden, ping [@infinidoge](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/infinidoge.md)
in the [#core](https://discord.com/channels/772576325897945119/890595036855685181) channel to get account onboarding steps.
This is useful for accessing shared accounts and other club resources.

## All-Hands Meetings

Most Sundays at 6:00 PM EST, we have all-hands meetings where we discuss club updates, upcoming events, and other important
information. **You must attend these meetings**, as they are crucial for keeping up-to-date with the club's operations. If
you can't make it to a meeting, make sure organizers know ahead of time.

All of our meeting notes are stored in [dark-forest](https://github.com/purdue-hackers/dark-forest). If you
want to see what was discussed in previous meetings, you can check out the meeting notes there.

For more info on All Hands, check out the [README](/meta/meetings/all-hands/README.md).

## Communications

All of our internal communications are done through Discord! Make sure you keep up-to-date with the club's channels and
participate in discussions. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the appropriate channel.
