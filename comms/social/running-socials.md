## Tone of Voice

This includes:
- lowercase captions
- fun emojis/creatura doodles

We decide to create our posts for the sake of originality. As a result, we tend to stray away from templates and recommend using some of the following software to create your own content to post, following the current Purdue Hackers brand. Feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with.
