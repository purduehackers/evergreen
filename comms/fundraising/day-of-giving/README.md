# Day of Giving

The Purdue [Day of Giving](https://dayofgiving.purdue.edu/) is an annual
fundraising event run by the Purdue for Life Foundation. It runs over the
course of 24 hours and allows various alumni, students, and others invested
in Purdue to donate to various causes and organizations at the university.

We can sign up to participate in the Day of Giving by registering our
club through an email sent via Boilerlink to the club's president and
treasurer.

Once we are registered, we get a link to our club's donation page, via which
we can accept donations. There are also various challenges that occur
during the Day of Giving, however it's damn near impossible to win them as
a student organization (we can't compete with Purdue Bands for example).

Money raised during the Day of Giving goes to the Purdue Hackers goes to the
BOSO TooCOOL account after some indeterminate amount of time.

We have not yet determined a strategy for the Day of Giving, but we should
probably do something to encourage donations from our alumni and friends.
