# Interclub Outreach

Interclub Outreach is an initiative to help Purdue Hackers interact with other clubs and organizations on campus.
The primary goal is to foster a sense of community and collaboration between different groups on campus, while
also promoting the Purdue Hackers brand and mission and helping to grow our organization.
