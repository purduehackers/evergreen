# Evergreen It

Wack Hacker can automatically create and assign issues for users. To use this
feature, you can reply to a Discord message you want to start an Evergreen
issue from with `evergreen it` or simply reply `evergreen it` and it will
automatically use the last message in the channel.

It uses the [associations.json](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/associations.json)
list in [purduehackers/dark-forest](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest)
to automagically assign issues.

Once the issue is created, the user is expected to go in and modify the title
and add additional information as needed, along with assigning the appropriate
labels and assignees.
