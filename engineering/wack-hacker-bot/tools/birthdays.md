# Birthdays

Wack Hacker has the ability to keep track of birthdays and will wish
people a happy birthday when the time comes! There are a few commands used
to manage this:

- `/birthday <month> <day>`: Sets a birthday for the user who sent the command.
- `/rm_birthday`: Removes the birthday for the user who sent the command.

There are also some admin commands to manage birthdays:

- `/admin_check_birthdays <month> <day>`: Used to debug birthdays and check
  if they are in the database.
