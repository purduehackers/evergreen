# Site Design Doc

- **DRI**: [@letttttttuce](https://github.com/purduehackers/dark-forest/blob/main/people/organizers/letttttttuce.md)

## Objective

Design and build a new landing page for Purdue Hackers that embodies our unique brand and serves as a public-facing resource for people to learn more about the club (what we do and how to join).

## Background

### Problem

- Current site is out of date, need an updated site to reflect new branding and represent our online presence
- Need a dedicated website to communicate what the club does and how interested individuals can get involved

### Stakeholders

- Primary Stakeholders: Prospective members, event sponsors, partner organizations, external collaborators
- Secondary Stakeholders: Club members, organizers

### Existing Solutions

- [Current Site](https://github.com/purduehackers/site)

### Alternative Solutions

?

## Requirements

### Goals

- Create an engaging and informative landing page to introduce the Purde Hackers to the public
- Highlight the club's mission, past projects, and upcoming events
- Provide a clear and user-friendly process for joining the club
- Ensure the site is mobile-friendly and accessible to all users
- Include contact information and links to the club's Discord, blog, social media channels, and other relevant resources

### Non-Goals

- Serve as a private dashboard or resource repository for current members
- Produce infinite gold
- Revive your grandmother

### Constraints

- The website must align with the club’s branding and visual identity
- Should be deployable using free or low-cost hosting services
- Should be easy to maintain and update with new content

## Design

### Architecture
- Frontend: Static website built with Next/React.js
- Backend: Not required; content will be static or managed via a CMS (Sanity)
- Hosting: Vercel

### Implementation
- Modular, component-based structure
- Integration of third-party libraries when necessary (i.e. for 3D rendering, animations)

### Content
- Landing Page Content:
- Page sections: Hero, club overview, Hack Night (featured projects, passport cermonies), Community/Workshops, blog, sponsorship info, call to action
- Event Fields: Title, date/time, location, description
- Contact Fields: Email address, social media links

- TODO: Update this with more specifics

### UI/UX Design
- [Brand Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/3hvWVV9EF86eJJunNnN1w3/Designs?node-id=0-1&t=UTTgOYXRKbkijHh6-1)
- [Site Prototype](https://site-24.vercel.app/)

### Deployment
[Link Vercel Deployment](https://vercel.com/purdue-hackers/site-24)

### Testing
- Test for mobile, cross-browser compatibility, accessibility

## Milestones

1. Finalize content structure, wireframes, and branding guidelines
2. Build foundational site structure and sections (About, Events, Join Us, etc.)
3. Conduct user testing and make adjustments based on feedback
4. Iterate and polish
5. Launch website and promote on social media

## Additional Considerations

### Performance
- Optimize images and assets for quick loading times
- Use SVG/PNG/JPG for images, GLTF for 3D assets
-   (specify here) file types, rendering pipeline etc etc
- Leverage static site generation for fast page delivery

### Maintenance
- Designate club organizers to update content periodically (e.g., events, contact information)
- Conduct (some period, annual?) reviews to refresh design and content
