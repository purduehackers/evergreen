# Events Design Doc

- **DRI**: @ericswpark

## Objective

Display upcoming and past events of Purdue Hackers

## Background

### Problem

The Events site allows attendees of Purdue Hackers events to receive email notifications and to look back on past events.

### Stakeholders

All (current and potential) members of Purdue Hackers

### Existing Solutions

This is an existing solution.

### Alternative Solutions

<!-- TODO: redesign -->

## Requirements

### Goals

> Clearly defined goals that the project aims to achieve.
> Should be measurable and achievable.

### Non-Goals

> What will this project not achieve?
> Define the scope of the project to prevent scope creep.

### Constraints

> Any limitations that the project must function within that aren't
> immediately obvious.

## Design

> How will this project be implemented? This section is more freeform and can vary
> by person and project. Some suggested sub-headings:
> - Architecture
> - Implementation
> - Data Models
> - User Interface
> - Deployment
> - Testing

## Milestones

> Rough estimate of the timeline for the project. This can be broken down into
> smaller milestones if needed. Can be dates or Hack Nights.

## Additional Considerations

### Security

> Security concerns and how they will be addressed. (Optional)

### Performance

> Performance needs and how they will be addressed. (Optional)

### Maintenance

> How will this project be maintained? Who will be responsible for it after
> rollout?
