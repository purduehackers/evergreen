# Passport Ceremony 5.2 Retro

- pre-ceremony prep
    - materials were set up such that each person got a “folder” (data page folded over)
    - all stations were prepped on time
    - nts: distribute all items for steps that could be parallelized
    - nts: learn how to setup the singer machine so we can do it ourselves
- attendance
    - 9/10 people arrived on-time
        - absent: ramazan
        - nts: ramazan materials were missing from our stack
    - people were generally enthused
    - more people congregated around (shows interest)
    - nts: some people thought that they could make their own passport and didn’t realize this was a reservation-based system
    - nts: reservation-based system creates some sense of “exclusivity” which might turn away some people/doesn’t make passports feel communal/cultural
- beginning steps
    - gave a rundown of the entire ceremony
    - cutting data pages went well
        - nts: should we cut on countertop?
        - nts: put down book tape before cutting
        - nts: should we put down book tape on both sides?
    - book tape step didn’t go as nicely as desired (for us organizers) but the attendees were still really pleased with their data pages
        - nts: communicate the method for putting down tape
        - nts: play back ruien book tape method
    - rounding corners went well
        - nts: procure more corner rounders so we can make this step go faster
- sewing went really really well!!!
    - personally super happy with this station, i think everyone was able to use the machine well and we got super straight bindings
    - shoutout @jaddenki for being super awesome with teaching
    - machine did catch and threads got mixed up but we were able to troubleshoot and fix things pretty quickly
- heat press station went well
    - ruien’s passport had an “issue” where he couldn’t get the letters to peel off correctly so he kept putting it under the heat press, stopped him and peeled the sheet for him
    - one person accidentally took a letter off with the vinyl and couldn’t reposition it so we gave him an extra
- glue step went well
    - nts: need to communicate less glue, position laminate at the edge of the passport leather
- dry/press step needs improvement
    - had to manually fix some passports alignments while they were wet before we put them underneath some boxes and tools to dry/press
    - not enough time to dry press before checkpoint time
- activation ceremony
    - 5/9 passports activated
    - some people left before activation; late at night, misunderstood
    - used time at the end of checkpoints to have people come up with their passports and have them activated
    - nts: need to figure out how to properly “demo” passports and recognize their activation without it being long and just a line of people getting their passports tapped with a phone
    - nts: need to have people stamp their passport after then finish making it
- shoutouts: @jaddenki sewing, @letttttttuce heat press, @stopwatchtt all-around helpfulness, @infinidoge13371 advice on how things have worked + others along the way
