*Written by Rachel Sacdalan*

This file serves as a guide on how to market Purdue Hackers workshops and other events to professors and students. 

Outline:
1. Find a class in the Email Directory
2. Create an Email Template
3. Attach poster from the Design Team
4. Send Email
5. Repeat

It is recommended to send these emails about 5-10 days before the start of the event.

# 1. Email Directory

At the beginning of every semester, go through [TimeTable](https://timetable.mypurdue.purdue.edu) or [boilerclasses](https://boilerclasses.com/) and track which professors are teaching the core CS courses. You can do this through a spreadsheet or other venues. In order to obtain the email of a professor, you can use the [Purdue Directory](https://www.purdue.edu/directory/). The `# Enrolled` column represents a rough estimate of how many people are enrolled in the class according to TimeTable.

Please note if you do use [boilerclasses](https://boilerclasses.com/) to obtain your information, I recommend data checking against TimeTable as some of the instructor information may be wrong.

See below for an updated directory of classes as of Fall 2024. If you feel inspired to capture a larger audience, I recommend looking into other classes and majors, such as Polytechnic, Engineering, and AI.

If you are under a time crunch and / or do not have many people to help with advertising, you can pick and choose which classes to advertise to. I would prioritize CS Core Classes, CS Opportunity Update, and The Data Mine.

# 2. Creating Email Templates
You can find past emails under `phackers@purdue.edu` under the Sent Items folder.
## Professors
Here is an outline of a sample email:

```
Hello Professor [Name],

Happy [Day of the Week]! I'm writing to share of our upcoming [workshop / event] on [date] and we would sincerely appreciate if you could please advertise our event to your students in class via Brightspace or any discussion forums.

Here are the details of the event:
	[Event Description]
	
	Get an email reminder here: [link]

We have also attached the poster to this email as a PNG and a PDF format for your convenience. Thank you for your support and please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you again!

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
```

I recommend titling the subject as the following: `[Class] Request to Advertise [Event] (Date)`
- Example: `[CS 180] Request to Advertise Shaders Workshop (3/28)`
### Email Template:

```
Hello Professor Adams and Professor Dunsmore!

Good evening — we hope you had a good weekend! I'd like to share details of our **Sentence Embedding Workshop**, a sequel of the Word Embeddings Workshop two weeks ago! We would be greatly appreciate it if you could share this in class as well as on Brightspace. Here are the details of the event:

	👁 Learn about sentence embeddings at our workshop on **Thursday, Oct 5th** from **8-9PM** @ **SMTH 108** hosted by **MLPurdue** and **Purdue Hackers**!  
      
    We'll be teaching you the basics of sentence embeddings, querying documents like textbooks, add context to an LLM, and build our own chat bot 🧠💻  
      
    🔗 https://events.purduehackers.com/word-embedding-workshop

Attached is the poster in both PNG and PDF formats. Feel free to let us know if you have any questions, thank you!


Best,
Purdue Hackers
```
## CS Opportunity Update
```
Hello Mrs. Morgan,

Happy Monday! I'd like to share details of our Word Embedding Workshop, it's our first joint workshop with MLPurdue and we would like to share it in the CS Weekly Newsletter / CS Opportunity Update. Here are the details of the event:

	📚 Dive into the world of word embeddings at our workshop on **Thursday, Sept 14th** from **8-9PM** @ **RAWL 1086** hosted by **MLPurdue** and **Purdue Hackers**!  
    
    We'll be teaching you how to represent words as vectors, train a word embedder on a dataset, do some cool math with words, and build something awesome out of it 🧠⚡  
      
    🔗 [https://events.purduehackers.com/word-embedding-workshop](https://events.purduehackers.com/word-embedding-workshop)

Kind regards,
Purdue Hackers
```

## Data Mine
```
Hello Dr. Ward, Elizabeth, and friends at The Data Mine!

Happy Monday! We'd like to share details of our Word Embedding Workshop, it's our first joint workshop with MLPurdue and some of our members have expressed interest in having this count as an outside event in The Data Mine 👁 Here are the details of the event:

	📚 Dive into the world of word embeddings at our workshop on **Thursday, Sept 14th** from **8-9PM** @ **RAWL 1086** hosted by **MLPurdue** and **Purdue Hackers**!
	
	We'll be teaching you how to represent words as vectors, train a word embedder on a dataset, do some cool math with words, and build something awesome out of it 🧠⚡

Kind regards,
Purdue Hackers
```
# 3. Attachments
In the past, professors have requested for a PDF version of the poster. You can convert the design from a PNG to a PDF [here](https://png2pdf.com/).

Feel free to name the attachments: `Purdue Hackers - [Event] (Date)`
# 4. Sending the Email
Before you send the email, check to make sure:
- [ ] Am I sending this email to the right person?
- [ ] Do I have the correct class?
- [ ] Correct Event?
- [ ] Correct Date
- [ ] Attached poster?

Once you've checked all of the above, feel free to ~~cross out~~ the class from your list. If you're using a spreadsheet, mark it as completed with your name.
# Notes
In the past, the PR team has created a spreadsheet to keep track of advertising. You can find it on the Purdue Hackers Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1S-3LA27mY-CqHXuqIBPAAnLS69nwhbrQ) if you have access.

This process can definitely be improved. One idea for generating the email directory can include fetching information from some sort of API, maybe `boilerclasses`? Feel free to figure out what works best.

If you are feeling overwhelmed with the amount of classes you have to email (it is a lot), do not hesitate to ask any of the other organizers for help.

Good luck!!! :^)
