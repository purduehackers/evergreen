# 1. Brainstorm Topic
As a team, find a concept, topic, or idea that vibes with the general Purdue Hackers Members. Bonus points if we have multiple people extremely interested to present a topic to a larger group. Hack Night sessions can eventually blossom into workshops!

Thoughtful Questions:
- [ ] Who is the target audience of this workshop?
- [ ] Will we need multiple sessions for this workshop?
- [ ] What do we want someone to get out of this workshop?
	- Goal: By the end of this workshop, you will have a [project] and better understanding of [concept]

# 2. Coordinate a Date and Time
Work with the presenter and other organizers to find a date and time for the workshop.

Thoughtful Questions:
- [ ] Are there any conflicting events happening at the same time?
	- Exams, fairs, classes, etc
- [ ] Weather?
	- In an ideal scenario, no matter if it's raining, freezing, burning, etc maybe people will come to the workshop anyways!

# 3. Book a Room
[Insert TimeTable Instructions Here on Booking a Room]

Thoughtful Questions:
- [ ] How many people do we estimate coming to this workshop?
- [ ] How is the wifi signal in the venue?
- [ ] Are there outlets available?
- [ ] Easy to Navigate?
# 4. Advertise Event
Work with the Design Team and Social Media group(s) and provide them the following information:
- Date / Time
- Location
- Workshop Details
- Pre-Workshop Requirements / Suggestions?

Advertising should be done 5-10 days before the start of the event. Be sure to post reminders on the `#announcements` channel and Instagram story as needed.

Make sure to also create an event posting on our [events site](https://events.purduehackers.com) via `sanity.io`. Contact any of the organizers for access.
# 5. Create Slides / Resources
# 6. Run-Through / Feedback
# 7.  Day-Of Workshop
If you buy snacks (such as a 30-pack of chips from Target), make sure to submit for reimbursement in the `#receipts` channel.

Be sure to take pictures of the event! You can either rent a camera from [insert location] or use your phone and send them in Discord ([or another place]) later. These can be posted on our Instagram story as well as our events page.

Have a few organizers available to walk around and answer any questions attendees may have.

In the event that a room goes over capacity, be prepared to stream or record the workshop via phone or a computer. We have YouTube and Twitch accounts but these have been one-off / as needed. Further instructions may be added in the future. This process should be tested during the Run-Through day.

Post slides, recordings, and other resources in the `#announcements` channel on the Discord after the workshop.
# 8. Reflect
Take notes and reflect on how each workshop has gone to improve for the future.

Thoughtful Questions:
- [ ] How could we have run this workshop better?
- [ ] Were there any hiccups? Mistakes? How could we have solved them?
- [ ] Was there a better venue?
- [ ] How engaged was our audience? Did we meet the workshop goal?
