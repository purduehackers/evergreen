# 1. Find Someone Cool
Possibly someone already giving us money and someone people like!
# 2. Coordinate Time and Place
Figure out if we want an in-person venue. This is possibly dependent on the VIP if they're joining remote or not. Make sure to [book a room].
# 3. Research
What questions have other people asked VIP in the past? Did they have an AMA on Reddit? What accomplishments have they had?

For the Steve Wozniak AMA, Sriram read iWoz and gathered interesting questions in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19i5JdZ4o4JJj1YO1ihXYg8-N9SCgImD8M2JCoidqsbI/edit?usp=sharing) and Rachel webscraped the Wozniak Reddit AMA in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lGt5YeFHK4uUsN5qLUb-qnP_A-zZLdLJg15XL0m8DU/edit#heading=h.28py2jfxe2au) and code.
# 4. Pre-Game
Similar to workshop logistics, advertise the event as usual. Advertising to classes is optional. For the Woz AMA for example, we limited attendees to mostly active Purdue Hackers members and opened it up to everyone later on.

Open up a temporary channel for the AMA for community members to discuss questions and etc. Feel free to add cooldowns to the channel.

Figure out who we want to prioritize for asking questions.

You can also optionally create a Day-Of Plan so all the organizers are on the same page. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sTP2LHqpo0pL33XVSDuZ9TShoR4_M6KUsCu7h78ZLwE/edit) for the Steve Wozniak Day-Of Plan.

Create a Zoom Meeting link. 
# 5. In-Person Logistics
There should be 1-2 hosts that will lead the discussion with the VIP. To start the AMA, the hosts will introduce Purdue Hackers, the VIP, and then themselves. Their goal is to make the vibe very conversational. Hosts will alternate between questions and make brief follow-up comments then open up the floor for people in-person to ask any questions.

There will also be moderators monitoring the Zoom meeting. Their goal is to pick people to ask questions based on vibes (participation and personality). For each question, the moderators will provide the hosts with the following info:
- Name
- Question
- Anything else that might help
They will make sure to watch for any disruptive people in the Zoom call, making sure to mute and take note of who they are.
# 6. Online Logistics
There should be one person in charge of streaming / recording the meeting online. It is recommended to use OBS Studio and stream to the Purdue Hackers YouTube channel.

To start the stream, navigate to `OBS -> Manage Broadcast -> Create Info`.
- Title: `Purdue Hackers - VIP AMA`
- Description: `Got Questions for VIP? Send them in our Discord: puhack.horse/discord`
- Privacy: `Unlisted` or `Public`
- Category: `Science & Technology`
Make sure to disable chat.

If you have a second computer, you can join the meeting on Zoom and screen record the AMA as a grid.

Be sure to upload to YouTube once you're done.
# 7. Post-Event
Upload the recording onto YouTube. Optionally, you could time-stamp the recording as well. Feel free to use [the Steve Wozniak AMA video](https://youtu.be/25RlBawQEb4?si=fkvNeWWLERl-VK8i) as a baseline format. Post the video in `#announcements`, Instagram, and other social media platforms. Feel free to also create a thumbnail.
